.vim and .vimrc backup
--------------------
* .vimrc contains:
  * General configuration
  * Keybindings for how I like to use vim with Colemak
  * Configuration for using clang-complete (only tested on Debian testing)
  * Configuration for jedi, underused at the moment and probably in need of some work eventually
  * Configuration for supertab
* .vim contains
  * Color themes and plugins
  * Plugins are included as git submodules when applicable
